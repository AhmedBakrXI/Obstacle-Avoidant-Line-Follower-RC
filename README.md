# System Dynamics and Control: RC Car Line Follower with Obstacle Avoidance
 

In the System Dynamics and Control Component Course Project, our team successfully developed an RC car with impressive capabilities, combining line-following functionality with obstacle avoidance.

Key Components:

1. **Microcontroller:** We utilized the Arduino UNO, a versatile microcontroller, as the brain of our project.

2. **Motor Control:** To ensure smooth movement, we integrated the L298 motor driver, which effectively controlled the two geared motors powering the RC car.

3. **Sensing Technology:** The car is equipped with two IR sensors, allowing it to detect and respond to the surrounding environment effectively.

4. **Drive System:** We implemented a robust drive system with two geared motors, enabling precise control and movement.

5. **Chassis:** The car's chassis provides a sturdy foundation for all the components, ensuring stability and durability.

6. **Power Supply:** Two 3.7V lithium-ion batteries were employed to provide ample power for prolonged operation.

Through our dedicated efforts in the System Dynamics and Control course, we successfully created an advanced RC car that not only follows lines with precision but also navigates around obstacles seamlessly. This project not only highlights our technical skills but also underscores our ability to apply system dynamics and control principles in a practical and innovative manner.
